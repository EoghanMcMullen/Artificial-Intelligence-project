# Artificial-Intelligence-project

A project in which I created an AI game. 
The aim here was to create a pacman like game where the Human player is chased around a grid by a group of computer characters.

The game was built using The World Wide Mind project. http://w2mind.computing.dcu.ie/sys/index.php

All the code is in Java.
